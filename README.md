cpuminer-gr-rtm
===============

It is higly optimized raptoreum miner from original code.


What is the goal ?
------------------

The original raptoreum miner have several third party llibraries
and normally, they are configured to produce native code to run on any x86 platform.
In this repo, all libraries configured and compiled separately for each platform to gain the maximum performace.

Update 19.11.2021
-----------------

Original miner's windows binaries had been built on linux via cross compiler tools.
From now on, all windows binaries will be built on windows by GCC 11.2 to ensure max performace.

Usage
-----

Typical usage like original miner on 64 bit Windows OS.

Happy minig!
